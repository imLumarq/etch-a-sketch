Etch A Sketch is a mechanical drawing toy invented by Andr√© Cassagnes of France and subsequently manufactured by the Ohio Art Company.It is now owned by Spin Master of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

An Etch A Sketch has a thick, flat gray screen in a red plastic frame. There are two white knobs on the front of the frame in the lower corners. Twisting the knobs moves a stylus that displaces aluminum powder on the back of the screen, leaving a solid line. The knobs create lineographic images. The left control moves the stylus horizontally, and the right one moves it vertically.
